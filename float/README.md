# FLOAT (BETA)
Based on Mitch Lustig's original Balance Package but specifically tailored for Onewheels. Removes unneeded parameters, adds new features and behaviors, and has a more user-friendly configuration menu with usable default values and helpful Help text.

Ported by Nico Aleman, heavily based on SurfDado's ATR Firmware: https://pev.dev/t/atr-firmware-101/43
